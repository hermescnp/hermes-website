One captures the silhouette of a lifeguard tower, its innovative scissors-like design challenging conventional forms, evoking both functionality and poetry in motion. Beside it, another frame reveals a mobile app that measures the intangible worth of artistic industries—a digital exploration into the value of creativity, untethered by the pursuit of profit.\n\nThese visions were born not from a need to monetize, but from the pure, unfiltered desire to explore and experiment. Here, design transcends the ordinary, and every project is an intimate conversation between the creator and the possibility of what might be. The Prototype Wall is a gentle reminder that sometimes, the most profound innovations arise when we build not for the market, but for our own souls."

        "documentation": "# Case: \"It's not that hard to catch humans”\n\nIn this evocative handmade surreal drawing, Hermes distills a profound social commentary into a single, arresting image. At first glance, a serene floating island cradles a treasure concealed beneath a solitary tree, a beacon of allure and promise. Yet, as one’s gaze travels beyond this inviting tableau, the island is revealed to be circumscribed by a vast, imposing cage. Circling this prison are sharks, their presence both graceful and menacing, as they patrol the periphery with an ever-watchful vigilance.\n\nThe long, winding path that leads to the treasure serves as a metaphor for human ambition and the pursuit of wealth. However, the very guardians of this coveted bounty (the sharks) hint at a darker truth. The treasure, rather than being a reward, is cast in the role of bait, meticulously placed to ensnare the unsuspecting traveler. In this paradox, Hermes exposes the vulnerability of human desire: even when the trap is laid bare, the seductive pull of riches remains irresistibly potent.\n\nBy interweaving elements of nature and contrived design, the drawing challenges the viewer to confront the paradox of temptation. It is a visual allegory that critiques how the promise of material gain can often mask a deliberate ploy; a reminder that what glitters may well be a well-orchestrated snare, poised to capture those who dare to dream too freely.\n\n### About Hermes’s Drawing Skill\n\n![Hermes with seft portrait](/user-sources/Hermes-autorretrato.JPG)\n\nHermes Concepción is a technical artist whose drawing skills form the backbone of his creative process. He excels at conceptualizing and explaining ideas in a fast, direct manner, ensuring that his visions are both clear and impactful. His journey into digital visualization began with a solid foundation in traditional drawing, which naturally led him to explore the digital realm.\n\nIn his work, Hermes has developed a keen understanding of essential visual elements:\n\n- **Conic Perspective:** He leverages this technique to create depth and realism in his compositions, making complex scenes appear three-dimensional.\n- **Lighting and Shading:** His expertise in these areas helps to enhance the mood and spatial dynamics of his pieces, guiding the viewer’s eye to important details.\n- **Texturing:** Hermes applies texture to bring a tactile quality to his visuals, adding a layer of authenticity and detail that enriches the overall design.\n- **Stylization:** By creatively modifying and refining visual elements, he is able to infuse his work with a distinctive style that stands out.\n\nThis blend of technical precision and artistic creativity enables Hermes to bridge the gap between concept and execution, making him a valuable asset in any project that requires both technical insight and aesthetic finesse."

Dominating the space is an immense, otherworldly tree; a symbolic beacon that defies conventional architectural logic. Its sprawling, surreal branches represent the uncharted pathways of thought, providing a visual metaphor for deep concentration and the organic growth of innovative ideas.\n\nBeneath this striking arboreal figure lies a digital easel paired with a solitary chair: a minimalist yet potent setup for contemplation. Here, the tools of the trade are both literal and metaphorical. The easel stands as a platform for conceptual sketches, algorithms, and design frameworks, while the chair invites one to pause, reflect, and dissect the intricate problems of computer graphics and interactive experiences. This is where mathematical precision converges with artistic expression, forming a sanctuary for UX refinement and tech-art exploration.\n\nIn this elevated retreat, the seemingly paradoxical elements (a fantastical tree, a digital canvas, and the quiet intensity of focused thought) come together to illustrate a personal paradise for innovation. It is a realm where the complexities of digital interactivity are unraveled and reimagined, one deliberate stroke of insight at a time."

        "documentation": "# Case: “Que tu estés aquí” (composition, arrangement and interpretation)\n\n![Prané - Que tu estés aquí](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1bch_8JlU)\n\n### Song Composition\n\n**Melodic and Harmonic Structure:**\n\nThe composition focuses on an emotional melody based on the musical theme \"Corales Del Sur\" created by Mando. Although the song was not originally intended for a duet, the recorded version was made together with Maite Reyes, who was a member of the band \"Prané\" founded by Hermes in 2014. Underpinning this is a contemporary harmonic progression that subtly shifts to mirror the lyrical nuances, providing a warm yet introspective backdrop. This approach is common in tracks where the lyrical content (here suggested by the title’s emphasis on presence and connection) drives the emotional core of the song.\n\n**Lyric-Driven Narrative:**\n\nThe lyrics, implied by the title “Que tu estés aquí” (“You To Be Here”), play a central role in the composition. The song begins with the narration of multiple idealistic and utopian wishes or dreams, which when reaching the chorus, take a nostalgic turn saying \"but... I want you to be here\", implying that all these utopian wishes are not enough without the company of the loved one.\n\n![Prané Band Recording](/user-sources/Prane-band-recording.PNG)\n\n### Arrangement and Production\n\n**Layering and Instrumentation:**\n\nThe arrangement transforms the core composition into a dynamic sonic landscape. It likely begins with a minimalist introduction—perhaps featuring a solo instrument or ambient textures—to set a contemplative mood. As the song progresses, additional layers are introduced: rhythmic elements, gentle percussion, and complementary instruments such as acoustic or electric guitars, keyboards, or subtle synth pads. This layering builds tension and then releases it in the chorus, underscoring the emotional peaks of the song.\n\n**Dynamic Contrast and Textural Shifts:**\n\nA hallmark of effective arrangement is the use of dynamics to guide the listener’s emotional journey. In “Que tu estés aquí,” quieter, more intimate sections allow the vocals and lyrics to take center stage, drawing the listener in. These are contrasted with fuller, richer passages where the full band or a more complex production arrangement takes over, amplifying the emotional intensity. This contrast not only provides variety but also mirrors the thematic elements of presence versus absence or intimacy versus expansiveness.\n\n![Hermes and Tiziano Audio-Editing](/user-sources/Hermes-and-Tiziano-Editing.PNG)\n\n**Fusion of Organic and Electronic Elements:**\n\nWhile the foundation might be built on organic instrumentation—like traditional guitar lines or piano chords—the arrangement may also incorporate subtle electronic textures. These ambient layers add depth and modernity to the track, helping it resonate with a contemporary audience while still maintaining a timeless quality. Such a blend is typical of many modern alternative tracks, where the warmth of acoustic sounds meets the precision and atmosphere of electronic production."

It merges the idea of prayer with the airy, soulful timbre of the Oriental Ney, channeling a profound sense of reverence for music’s deeper philosophies. Much like a liturgy rising above the hush of dusk, the name hints at a spiritual undercurrent, a plea and a melody intertwined.\n\n![Prané Music Band](/user-sources/Prane-Music-Band.png)\n\nIn the logotype, that sense of musical prayer echoes through the graceful union of letters. The triangle stands tall at the center, a silent spire reminiscent of an ancient temple’s archway, framing the band’s feline muse. The cat itself, perched in calm confidence, is both mysterious and unflinchingly cool, wearing an air of knowing aloofness, like a guardian spirit presiding over the creative realm. The minimal lines and shapes mirror the uncluttered purity of a single flute note in an empty cathedral, letting each element breathe.\n\nTogether, name and symbol become a mantra for the band’s philosophy: every note, every lyric becomes a quietly passionate offering “Prané” where music, like a prayer, ascends into something transcendental."

The research argues that traditional music distribution models—particularly streaming services—have devalued the financial sustainability of musicians. The solution proposed is an interactive, algorithm-driven approach that allows users to experience and modify musical compositions dynamically, much like interactive narratives in video games or digital media.\n\n## **Innovations in Interactive-Parametric Music**\n\n![MIP Thesis Book Opened](/user-sources/MIP-Book-opened.jpg)\n\nThe project presents a protocol for interactive music composition that integrates real-time parametric adjustments based on user input. The key innovations include:\n\n- **MIP Protocol:** This is the core innovation of the thesis by Hermes Concepción. It establishes a structured system for creating, organizing, and consuming music in an interactive, real-time adaptable format. Unlike traditional music composition, where pieces follow a fixed, linear progression, MIP allows for dynamic modification based on user interaction, much like adaptive video game music or interactive media narratives.\n- **Real-Time Musical Adaptation:** Unlike conventional compositions, MIP enables user-driven transformations, where parameters like tempo, harmony, and instrumentation can change in response to external inputs.\n- **Application of Parametric Design to Music:** Inspired by parametric architecture and design, MIP incorporates computational rules to generate flexible, adaptable musical structures.\n- **Integration with Video Games:** A prototype was developed using the video game Inside, demonstrating how music can evolve based on gameplay decisions.\n\n## **MIP vs. Traditional Music Systems**\n\n| Feature | Traditional Music | MIP Protocol |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Structure** | Linear, pre-recorded | Non-linear, modular, adaptable |\n| **Interactivity** | Passive listening | Real-time changes based on input |\n| **Playback Flexibility** | Fixed from start to end | User-driven flow and modifications |\n| **Adaptation** | Requires separate versions | Single framework can generate variations dynamically |\n| **Examples** | Albums, movie soundtracks | Video game music, AI-generated compositions, interactive installations |\n\nThe MIP Protocol is a revolutionary step toward a future where music is not just listened to, but experienced dynamically. By integrating parametric design principles with interactive audio techniques, it offers a new model for music creation, distribution, and consumption."

        "documentation": "# Case: “Almost a Happy World” (film scoring)\n\n![Almost a Happy World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4NoyatJI2c)\n\n\"Almost a Happy World\" (original title: \"Un Mundo Casi Feliz\") is a 3‑minute Dominican short film that uses humor and irony to examine the paradox of our hyper‐connected digital age. Directed and written by Danny Camacho (a filmmaker from Santo Domingo known for his energetic storytelling) the film follows roommates Jefri and Ariel, who are immersed in a lifestyle saturated with consumerism and constant online connectivity. Ironically, despite being always “plugged in,” their interactions reveal a growing emotional disconnect and a sense of isolation, highlighting how an overreliance on digital networks can undermine genuine human relationships.\n\nThe film’s sonic palette plays an essential role in reinforcing its satirical take on modern connectivity. Though \"Almost a Happy World\" runs only three minutes, its film score and sound design are carefully crafted to both complement and underscore the narrative’s ironic edge.\n\n![Almost a Happy World - Behind the audio recording](/user-sources/behind-scenes-AHW-02.png)\n\n### Film Scoring\n\nThe musical score—credited to Hermes Prané—features a mix of electronic and organic elements that mirror the dual nature of our digital age. On one hand, the score employs upbeat, rhythmic patterns and synthesized textures that evoke the constant hum of online notifications and digital chatter. These elements create a sense of urgency and overstimulation, echoing the frenetic pace of modern consumer culture. On the other hand, more subdued and contemplative motifs emerge at key narrative moments, reflecting the underlying loneliness and disconnect of the characters. This dynamic interplay between energetic digital sounds and softer, more reflective passages not only punctuates the film’s humor but also deepens its commentary on the paradox of being simultaneously connected and isolated.\n\n### Sound Effects and Design\n\nEqually important is the film’s sound design, which was also overseen by Hermes Prané. The sound effects are used with precision: everyday noises—the subtle clicks of digital devices, the murmur of ambient chatter, even the mechanical hum of urban life—are amplified and interwoven into the score. These layers of diegetic sounds (those that belong to the world of the film) contrast with the non-diegetic musical cues, drawing attention to the irony that while the characters are constantly \"online\", there is a palpable absence of authentic human warmth. In several scenes, the sound design deliberately isolates the viewer, using abrupt silences or minimalistic effects to signal moments of emotional emptiness. This approach reinforces the idea that despite the constant barrage of digital information, genuine, meaningful connection remains elusive.\n\n![Almost a Happy World - Behind the audio editing](/user-sources/behind-scenes-AHW-01.png)\n\n### Overall Impact\n\nTogether, the score and sound effects contribute to the film’s overall atmosphere—one that is at once playful and reflective. The energetic, digitally influenced music underscores the superficial allure of modern connectivity, while the careful layering of everyday sound effects reminds us of the isolation lurking behind our screens. In just three minutes, \"Almost a Happy World\" uses its sonic elements not only to entertain but also to provoke thought about the cost of our hyper-connected lifestyles. This meticulous attention to sound design makes the short film a compelling study in how audio can serve as both narrative punctuation and thematic reinforcement."

        "documentation": "# WebGL Coding\n\nWebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API that enables rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the need for additional plugins. Built on top of OpenGL ES (a subset of the OpenGL standard tailored for embedded systems), WebGL leverages the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU) to produce high-performance visual content directly in the browser. This capability has transformed how we experience the web, opening up innovative possibilities in design, gaming, data visualization, and more.\n\n## Redefining Digital Representation\n\n**3D Immersive Environments**\n\nHermes’s projects are more than just web pages—they are immersive 3D environments that transform how users perceive and interact with digital content. By using WebGL, he reimagines traditional UX design, moving away from flat interfaces to spatial, interactive experiences that provide depth, perspective, and context. Every product he creates is a re-conceptualization of digital entities, presenting them in three-dimensional space with a fresh, innovative twist.\n\n**Merging Art and Technology**\n\nAs a technical artist, Hermes bridges the gap between the precision of code and the creativity of visual art. WebGL is his digital brush, allowing him to paint with light and motion. This melding of technology and artistry results in products where every element—whether it’s a dynamic particle effect, an intricate texture, or a subtle shading gradient—is crafted to enhance the overall user experience. His work turns the web into a living canvas where design isn’t just seen—it’s experienced.\n\n**Sonic and Visual Harmony**\n\nWith his background as a professional musician, Hermes is uniquely positioned to integrate auditory elements with visual designs. WebGL’s capabilities extend beyond just visuals; they can be synchronized with sound to create multisensory experiences. Imagine a digital space where every movement or interaction is accompanied by a harmonious soundscape, making the experience as engaging aurally as it is visually. This synthesis of music and motion helps create environments that resonate on multiple levels, deeply engaging the user’s senses.\n\n**Pioneering Interactive Storytelling and Data Visualization**\n\nHermes’s work redefines storytelling by allowing users to “step into” the narrative. Through WebGL, digital narratives become interactive journeys where every element—from the environment to the characters—responds to user input in real time. Similarly, complex data can be transformed into 3D visualizations that are not only informative but also aesthetically compelling, providing insights that are both intuitive and engaging."

        "documentation": "# UX/Tech-Art Design Process\n\nHermes’s process is an iterative, structured approach to solving design challenges that begins with a thorough analysis of the problem and gradually evolves into a complete UX design wireflow and prototype. Using the ARTKET case as an example, here’s how this process might unfold:\n\n### Define and Analyze the Problem\n\nHermes’s process begins with a detailed problem analysis: identifying user pain points, market gaps, and business objectives. For ARTKET example, this involves clarifying tasks such as market analysis, generating custom quotes, and ensuring a seamless user experience. This step mirrors the initial sections of the document where the problem statement and proposal are outlined .\n\n### Brainstorming Ideas\n\n![UX Example Brainstorming](/user-sources/Arket-sketches-ui.png)\n\nNext, the process involves a creative brainstorming phase. In this stage, diverse ideas are generated to address the problem. For ARTKET, ideas might include:\n\n- How to simplify user registration and authentication (“Step 1: Authenticate”).\n- Innovative ways to display market data and analytics (“Step 2: Analyze the market”).\n- Integrating interactive features that encourage user engagement (“Step 3: Be part of the market”).This phase leverages group discussions and sketch sessions to explore multiple concepts without the constraints of technical feasibility initially.\n\n### Structuring the Solution with Diagrams\n\n![UX Example Diagram](/user-sources/user-journey-graphic.png)\n\nOnce a range of ideas is on the table, the next step is to start structuring the solution. Hermes’s process emphasizes the creation of diagrams to map out user flows and interface structures. For ARTKET, this involves:\n\n- Drafting initial flowcharts that depict user journeys—from registration and login to generating and editing price quotes.\n- Outlining key screens such as the welcome page, main dashboard, and service creation interfaces.\n- Iteratively refining these diagrams to ensure that each step logically flows into the next and that all user interactions are accounted for.The document includes several flow diagrams and wireflow sketches that exemplify this step, demonstrating how complex interactions are broken down into manageable screens and actions .\n\n### Developing a Complete UX Design Wireflow and Prototype\n\n![UX Example Wireflow](/user-sources/UX-wireflow-example.png)\n\nWith a well-structured diagram in place, the process moves toward building a high-fidelity wireflow and interactive prototype. This stage involves:\n\n- Translating the diagrams into detailed wireframes that define the layout, navigation, and key functionalities.\n- Testing these wireframes with stakeholders and potential users to gather feedback.\n- Iterating on the design until it evolves into a complete UX design that captures both the analytical and creative aspects of the platform.In the ARTKET case, the final prototype integrates business logic, user statistics, and creative flow elements into one cohesive system, demonstrating a balance between functional analysis and user-centered design.\n\nHermes’s process takes you from an in-depth understanding of the problem, through creative brainstorming and diagrammatic planning, to a fully-realized UX design and prototype. The ARTKET document serves as a practical example of this approach, showcasing everything from early-stage flowcharts to a detailed wireflow prototype that addresses the specific needs of an art market analytics platform.\n\n![UX Example Prototype](/user-sources/Arket-UI-Mockups.png)"
